Java Bells
============

A Jingle implementation Java based on LibJitsi, Ice4J and Smack

Jitsi offers many features that would desirable to add to an XMPP library, including
Jingle and ICE. Unfortunately, these features are not easily accessable to developers
or well documented.
This project aims to make these features available to developers with good sample code
and decent documentation.

This library is not yet functional and is, frankly, a bit of a mess.
