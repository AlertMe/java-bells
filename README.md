Java Bells
============

A Jingle implementation for Java based on LibJitsi, Ice4J and Smack

Jitsi implements many features that would be desirable to add to an XMPP library, including
Jingle and ICE. Unfortunately, these features are not easily accessable to developers
nor are they well documented.
This project aims to make these features available to developers with good sample code
and decent documentation.

This library is not yet functional and is, frankly, a bit of a mess, but we're getting there.


Compiling and Running
-------------------

To compile and run, you can use the included ant build.xml file. All the required libraries
are included with the distrobution. The compile target compiles the code and the test target
compiles and runs a test. ATM the test is incomplete and requires you to hit return to complete.
