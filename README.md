============

A Jingle Implementation for Smack based on Libjitsi.

Jitsi offers many features that would desirable to add to an XMPP library, including
Jingle and ICE. Unfortunately, these features are not easily accessable to developers.
This project aims to make these features available to developers with good sample code
and decent documentation.

This library is not yet functional and is, frankly, a bit of a mess.
